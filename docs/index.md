# 🕊️ Oldie-Goldie  

## Private, Peer-to-Peer, Encrypted Communication  

> *A Being Human Cult (BHC) Project*

Oldie-Goldie creates **temporary**, **invite-controlled**, **end-to-end encrypted** chat tunnels between trusted peers — without servers, accounts, or stored logs.  
It is lightweight, privacy-focused, and fully open source.

This documentation will help you:

- Install and run Oldie-Goldie
- Host secure local or public servers
- Use invite tokens & encrypted tunnels
- Understand the internal model
- Contribute to the project

## 🚀 Quick Start

If you're new:  
👉 **[Usage Guide](usage.md)** — How to run the server/client, use tokens, create tunnels.

If you're here to contribute:  
👉 **[Developer Guide](developer-guide.md)** — Architecture + development setup.

## ✨ What Oldie-Goldie Provides

- 🔒 **End-to-end encrypted tunnels** between two peers  
- 🪪 **Token-controlled access** (single-use, bound, reusable)  
- 🌐 **Automatic Cloudflared public URLs**  
- 🧳 **No log retention** — data never written to disk  
- 🕶 **Ephemeral, private, minimalistic chat sessions**  
- 🧩 **Cross-platform (Windows / macOS / Linux)**

## 📜 About the Project

Oldie-Goldie is an experiment in **human-first, privacy-first communication**,  
removing central servers and restoring peer-to-peer trust through:

- pseudonymous identity  
- shared secrets  
- ephemeral presence  
- local, auditable logic  

Built by **Being Human Cult (BHC)**.
